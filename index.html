                        semi-remote beaches. We're particularly big fans of Playa de Las Catedrales, a small stretch
                        of
                        sand on the Galician coast where natural stone arches form a walkable "cathedral" at low
                        tide.

                    <p>Every traveler should experience the ethereal glow and seemingly endless heights of this
                        bamboo
                        grove on the outskirts of Kyoto. The experience even extends beyond the visual realm: In
                        1996,
                        Japan's Ministry of the Environment included the sounds here—wood creaking, leaves
                        rustling—as
                        one of the top 100 Soundscapes of Japan.</p>

                    <p>It's hard to pick the single most beautiful place in Japan, but 12,388-foot Mount Fuji just
                        might take the prize. Visit Lake Kawaguchiko in the spring for some of the best views of the
                        mountain and cherry blossom trees—a postcard-worthy sight if we ever saw one. Or if you're
                        an
                        avid hiker, plan a trip for mid-July until the end of August, when the snow melts enough to

                        Flamingos (and the lake) look their best from December to April: the lake is full of water,
                        making it more reflective for photos, and the birds are breeding. Be sure to try and catch

                        And

                        landmarks on the island, and visitors can enjoy them in a variety of ways. A singular
